# TestingDoggos
Learn testing principles with doggos üê∂

This project is playground for learning and understanding the basics and importance of testing.
Including but not limited to manual and automated testing, TDD principles, code review, and optimization in terms of performance, UI and UX.
The end result will be a portal for an animal shelter, with guest and administrator modes.

Admin view will allow user to:

    - occupied
  - food
    - type
    - amount

Backend of the application will be written in Python. The frontend will be written using Javascript (Plain or using a framework).
All of the implemented interfaces should allow for testing.

The project is an assignment for a subject "Testing and code optimizaiton" in the University of Economics in Katowice.
