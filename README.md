## About The Project

This project serves as a playground for learning and understanding the basics and importance of testing. It encompasses a wide range of testing methodologies, including manual and automated testing, TDD principles, code review, and optimization in terms of performance, UI, and UX. The final deliverable is a portal for an animal shelter, featuring guest and administrator modes.

### Deployment

  The project is deployed using PythonAnywhere. You can access it [here](http://testingdoggos.pythonanywhere.com/).

### Features

- **Guest Mode:**
  - View animals available for adoption.
  - Donate animal food.

- **Admin Mode\*:**
  - Monitor, add, remove, edit, and manage resources.
  - Manage animal details such as name, type, race, age, weight, health, and photo.
  - Oversee animal beds by type, amount, and occupancy.
  - Control food supplies by type and amount.

  \* *Currently, the project is in the development phase. The admin mode is not yet implemented, therefore all features should be available in guest mode.*
